1. Characterizing the Listener’s Audio Aura

Based on the average values of energy, valence, and danceability from the songs in songs.db, this listener’s audio aura likely reflects a vibrant and emotionally upbeat personality. High energy suggests a preference for fast-paced, intense music; high valence points to emotionally positive or happy tracks; and high danceability implies rhythmic, groove-heavy songs ideal for movement. Together, this aura might be described as “joyful and dynamic” or “uplifting and rhythmic.”

2. Why This Aura Might Not Be Fully Representative

While the average of these three metrics gives a general sense of mood, it oversimplifies the complexity of a listener’s musical taste. Here’s why:

Lack of context: Averages ignore variability. A listener might enjoy both mellow acoustic ballads and high-energy EDM, but the average would dilute both extremes.

No temporal dimension: The data doesn’t show when songs were played. A person might binge sad songs during winter and dance tracks in summer, but the aura would blur seasonal shifts.

No genre or lyrical analysis: Energy and valence don’t capture lyrical themes. A song might sound upbeat but have melancholic lyrics.

Collaborative listening: Some songs might be played during parties or shared sessions, not reflecting personal taste.

3. Better Ways to Calculate the Aura

To create a more nuanced and representative aura, Spotify could:

Use clustering: Group songs into mood clusters (e.g., chill, hype, melancholic) and identify dominant clusters rather than relying on averages.

Incorporate time-series data: Track how listening habits change over time to reflect emotional arcs or seasonal moods.

Include genre and lyrics: Combine audio features with genre tags and sentiment analysis of lyrics for deeper emotional profiling.

Weight by frequency: Give more influence to songs played repeatedly versus one-off listens.
