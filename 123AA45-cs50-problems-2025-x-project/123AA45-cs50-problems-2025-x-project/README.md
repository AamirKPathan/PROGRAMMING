#### Description:
GameSwap TO is a community-driven web application designed for gamers in Toronto to buy, sell, and trade video games, consoles, and accessories. Built for the CS50 final project, the platform focuses on simplicity, trust, and user experience. It offers a clean interface and intuitive navigation, making it easy for users to explore listings, connect with sellers, and manage their own posts. Whether someone is looking for a rare retro cartridge or selling a next-gen console, GameSwap TO provides a local-first solution tailored to the gaming community.
Users can create listings with detailed descriptions, categories, prices, locations, and optional images. The homepage includes powerful search and filtering tools, allowing visitors to narrow results by keyword, category, price range, and location. Listings can be sorted by newest, price low-to-high, or price high-to-low. Quick category browsing buttons make it easy to jump into specific sections like Console, Accessory, Game, or Other. Each listing card displays essential information, including seller name and location, and includes buttons to message the seller, favorite the item, or report it.
The messaging system is built from scratch to support private conversations between buyers and sellers. Threads are organized by user, and messages include timestamps and read receipts. Notifications alert users to new messages, and unread threads are highlighted for visibility. Users can delete or archive threads to keep their inbox clean. This system ensures smooth communication and helps build trust between parties.
Favorites and wishlist features allow users to save listings they’re interested in and track items they’re hoping to find. The favorites page displays all saved items, while the wishlist input lets users submit keywords for specific items they want. This adds a layer of personalization and helps users stay engaged with the platform even when browsing casually.
Seller ratings are calculated from user reviews and displayed on listings to promote transparency. After a transaction, users can leave a rating and comment for the seller. These ratings are averaged and shown next to the seller’s name, helping buyers make informed decisions. This system encourages accountability and builds a reputation system within the community.
GameSwap TO also includes a dark mode toggle for accessibility and style. Users can switch between light and dark themes using a button in the navbar. The theme preference is saved using localStorage, so it persists across sessions. This feature enhances usability for night-time browsing and adds a modern touch to the interface.
An admin panel is available to the official GameSwap TO account, allowing for moderation and approval of listings. Admins can view pending posts, approve or reject them, and manage reported content. This ensures that all listings meet community standards and helps maintain a safe environment for users.
The application is built using Python, Flask, and SQLite on the backend, with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript on the frontend. Templates are rendered using Jinja2, and the database includes tables for users, listings, messages, reviews, favorites, and notifications. The project is organized into clear folders for templates and static assets, and the code is modular and well-commented for readability.
GameSwap TO was created with the goal of building a real-world platform that serves a specific community. Every feature was designed with intention, from the messaging system to the admin tools. The result is a robust, user-friendly marketplace that feels personal and practical. It’s a testament to what can be built from scratch with focus, creativity, and a passion for solving real problems.
