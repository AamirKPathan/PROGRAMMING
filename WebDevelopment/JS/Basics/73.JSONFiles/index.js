//JSON = javascript object notation
//It is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write
//and easy for machines to parse and generate.
//JSON is often used to transmit data between a server and a web application as text.
//Example of JSON data:
const jsonData = `{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30,
    "isStudent": false,
    "courses": ["Math", "Science", "History"],
    "address": {
        "street": "123 Main St",
        "city": "Anytown",
        "zip": "12345"
    }
}`;
