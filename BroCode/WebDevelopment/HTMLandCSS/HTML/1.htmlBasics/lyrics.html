            I'll take command, I'll take the army
            I'll take the crown, my mandate to rule
            I'll take your land, your independence
            And I will make it part of my realm

            Know that I will enforce the code that bears my name
            I will take what I deem is mine and claim the fame
            I will assimilate your land, my command
            So prepare, get your armies ready, I'll be coming

            I will conquer all, I will rule you
            I'll bring triumph or fall, I will defend you
            I'll make cannons roar, I'll defeat you
            I'll win the war, I will destroy you

            I'll be the fox, I'll be the lion
            I'll do what it takes to sit on the throne
            I play the game, where others will falter
            Control the truth, the power to rule
            
            While as I see my rise to rule as destiny
            May it be that five million dead's my legacy
            I will make nations bend and bow by my feet
            So prepare, get your armies ready, I'll be coming
            
            I will conquer all, I will rule you
            I'll bring triumph or fall, I will defend you
            I'll make cannons roar, I'll defeat you
            I'll win the war, I will destroy you
            
            Hear me now, soldiers of my old guard
            I have come to bid you all farewell
            For 20 years, you have joined me on the path to glory
            Farewell, my children, farewell
            
            While as I see my rise to rule as destiny
            May it be that five million dead's my legacy
            I will make nations bend and bow by my feet
            So prepare, get your armies ready, I'll be coming
            I'm returning
            
            I will conquer all, I will rule you
            I'll bring triumph or fall, I will defend you
            I'll make cannons roar, I'll defeat you
            I'll win the war, I will destroy you
            
            I will conquer all, I will rule you
            I'll bring triumph or fall, I will defend you
            I'll make cannons roar, I'll defeat you
            I'll win the war, I will destroy you
