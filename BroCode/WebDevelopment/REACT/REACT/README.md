# React Learning — BroCode Course Setup

This folder contains my complete React learning environment for following the BroCode React tutorial series.  
The goal is to keep every lesson and project organized, modular, and easy to run.

## 🎯 Purpose

This setup allows me to:

- Keep every lesson in its own folder  
- Keep every project in its own folder  
- Switch between lessons and projects instantly  
- Avoid renaming or moving files  
- Maintain a clean, scalable learning environment
